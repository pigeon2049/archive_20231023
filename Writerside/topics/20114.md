Earlier this year, _Final Fantasy XIV_ fans were treated to [a first look at the next expansion, _Dawntrail_](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/28/23811405/final-fantasy-xiv-7-0-new-expansion-dawntrail). Over the weekend, during the London leg of the _Final Fantasy XIV_ Fan Festival event, Square Enix shared a bit more detail about the expansion, including a new trailer revealing the newest class: Viper.

Viper will be a melee DPS class that seems similar to the Ninja class already present in the game. Vipers will dual-wield swords that can be fused together into one big sword for more damage a la Zidane from _Final Fantasy IX._ (Remember his Butterfly Sword?) As is tradition, the Viper was introduced by game producer Naoki Yoshida dressed up as the class, and as also is tradition, the look was pretty damn cool.

(Eat your _heart out,_ Todd Howard.)

There will be another caster class added with _Dawntrail,_ which likely won’t be revealed until the Japan Fan Festival event in January 2024. Fans are expecting it to be the pictomancer from _Final Fantasy VI_ since the new trailer has one of the characters painting and a possible hint from Yoshida himself, as he wore a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shirt to announce [_FFXIV_ was coming to the Xbox.](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/28/23811549/final-fantasy-xiv-xbox-square-enix) (Get it? One of the turtles dual-wields swords like the Viper class, and they’re all named after a famous painter.)

The London Fan Festival also revealed two collaborations were coming to the critically acclaimed MMORPG. Teased [back in August](https://youtu.be/hONetF8k2Y8?si=P4aVlGCaC3Hc-wN2), _Fall Guys_ is finally set to make its debut in _Final Fantasy XIV._ In the 6.5x series of patches, Warriors of Light will journey to Gold Saucer to compete in _Fall Guys_\-themed challenges and arenas with a _Final Fantasy XIV_ twist. Check out the trailer below. It’s... it’s something.

In yet another collaboration, Final Fantasies will collide as _XIV_ and _XVI_ come together for the first time.

In the trailer, it seems like Clive Rosfield will trade Valisthea for Eorzea, teaming up with Warriors of Light to battle Ifrit — again it seems. In addition to a new boss fight against the Eikon of Fire, the _FFXIV_ x _FFXVI_ collaboration (yes, that is far too many x’s) will also feature new _FFXVI_\-themed gear sets, mounts, and pets, including a Torgal mount that I simply _must_ acquire. No word yet on when this event will take place.
