Amazon has yet to release a public trailer for its highly anticipated _Fallout_ series, but at least we now know when it’ll arrive on our TV screens. The streaming giant has revealed that _Fallout_ — a live-action adaptation of Bethesda’s popular RPG video game franchise — will premiere on April 12th, 2024, exclusively via Prime Video.

The announcement was made on October 23rd, otherwise known to _Fallout_ fans as “Fallout Day” — the in-game date that marks the beginning of the Great War that turns the world into an irradiated nuclear wasteland. Bethesda’s executive producer and game director Todd Howard is an executive producer on the series, which stars Ella Purnell (_Yellowjackets_), Walton Goggins (_The Hateful Eight_), Aaron Moten (_Emancipation_), Moisés Arias (_The King of Staten Island_), Kyle MacLachlan (_Twin Peaks_), and Sarita Choudhury (_Homeland_).

Alongside the premiere announcement itself (which was amusingly presented as an interactive Pip-Boy interface graphic), Amazon said in a press release that the show will be an original story set in a future, post-apocalyptic version of Los Angeles and will be considered a canonical addition to the existing game franchise. We do not currently know how many episodes will be in the series or what the release schedule will look like following the premiere.

Video game adaptations are having a good run at the moment — [HBO’s _The Last of Us_](https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review) attracted record-breaking viewership numbers, and [_The Super Mario Bros. Movie_](https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review) became the [highest-grossing film based on a video game](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office) after just one week of release. Most of the information we’ve seen about the _Fallout_ show itself comes from a [leaked trailer back in August](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/tv-and-film/amazon-fallout-tv-series-first-trailer-345808-20230828) that teased some shots of a vault entrance and several characters walking in power armor. That doesn’t give us much to work with, but with any luck, it won’t be long before a full trailer is dropped.
