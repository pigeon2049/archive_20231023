The first music video from Heartsteel, Riot Games’ new virtual boy band starring characters from _League of Legends_, is here.

The video, for [the band’s first song, “Paranoia,”](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMDErQ1KTzaI) has a slick look that harkens back to the [awesome art style of _Arcane_](https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review), Netflix’s animated series set in the _League of Legends_ universe. While a second season for that show in the works, it’s not set [to release until Q4 2024](https://collider.com/arcane-season-2-release-window/), so this new video will have to tide you over for now. It helps that the song is pretty catchy. (You can hear it [on music streaming services, too](https://found.ee/HS-PARANOIA).)

Heartsteel is just one of many virtual _League_ bands, a roster that already includes [K-pop group K/DA](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21496800/kda-league-of-legends-k-pop-album-release-date), [Pentakill (heavy metal)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22650703/league-of-legends-wave-virtual-concert-pentakill-heavy-metal), and [hip-hop group True Damage](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton). Riot collaborates with real-life artists as well: K-pop band NewJeans is performing [Riot’s anthem for this year’s Worlds competition](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23885476/newjeans-league-of-legends-worlds-2023-anthem), and last year, the company teamed up with Lil Nas X for an anthem that he performed [during an impressive performance in November](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/6/23440640/worlds-2022-opening-ceremony-league-of-legends-lil-nas-x).
