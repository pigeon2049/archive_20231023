_Marvel’s Spider-Man 2_ has become the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios title in the 24 hours following its release, [Sony announced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231023019066/en/) on Monday. The game sold over 2.5 million copies in just one day.

[_Marvel’s Spider-Man 2_](https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5) was developed by PlayStation Studios’ Insomniac Games. As the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation title, it dethrones [_God of War Ragnarok_](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-the-fastest-selling-first-party-playstation-game-ever/), which sold 5.1 million copies during its launch week last year. The first _Marvel’s Spider-Man_ also got the [fastest-selling first-party](https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1042775621074669568?s=20) crown following its release in 2018, selling 3.3 million copies in its first three days.

The _Spider-Man_ sequel came out last Friday as the first PlayStation 5-exclusive game in the franchise. While the original _Spider-Man_ title was released for the PlayStation 4, _Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales_ came out for both the PS5 and PS4.

In addition to a new story arc, _Marvel’s Spider-Man 2_ adds some new game mechanics, including web wings that let you soar through New York City. There’s also a way to switch between Peter Parker and Miles Morales, complete with different quest lines for both characters.
