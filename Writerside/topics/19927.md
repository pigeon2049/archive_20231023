Google is adding some new features to the Google Play Games Beta on PC, its service that lets you play Android games on a PC, including support for 4K screen resolution on “supported monitors” and for popular console gaming controllers. Google detailed the updates in [a blog post from Arjun Dayal](https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-play-games-beta-october-2023-update/), Google Play Games’ director of product.

With the new support for 4K, you can now pick your screen resolutions while in game. “Simply press Shift + Tab in any game to select from a menu of supported resolutions,” according to Dayal.

The game controllers that are now supported include the Xbox Series X / S controller, the Xbox One controller, Sony’s DualSense controller for PS5, and its DualShock controller for PS4. Google isn’t the only company that’s making it easier to use your other controllers on its platform; Apple added iOS support for the DualSense and Xbox Series X controllers [with iOS 14.5](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support), while Valve rolled out DualSense support in Steam [in 2020](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591013/steam-input-api-ps5-dualsense-controller-support).

Dayal’s blog post has a couple of other updates, too. Dayal says that there are more than 3,000 games available in the Google Play Games catalog, including the new additions of _Clash of Clans_ and _Clash Royale_. Google is also adding a search bar to the “All games” section of Google Play Games on PC to make it easier to find a specific game.

Google has been slowly expanding the Google Play Games beta for PC, launching initially [in three countries in January 2022](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891046/google-play-games-android-games-windows-pc-beta-launch), in open beta in the US and a few other countries [in November 2022](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23436453/google-play-games-android-pc-open-beta), and in Europe and New Zealand [in May](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/25/23737091/google-play-games-for-pc-beta-europe-new-zealand-release).
