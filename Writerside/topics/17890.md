Bun is a fast, all-in-one toolkit for running, building, testing, and debugging JavaScript and TypeScript. Bun's goal is to eliminate slowness and complexity without throwing away everything that's great about JavaScript. Bun is tested against test suites of the most popular Node.js packages on Node.
