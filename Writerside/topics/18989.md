Abstract:

Exceptional, refined, and uniquely meaningful domain names have always been highly esteemed, and their value continues to ascend. Despite the potential decrease in search capability for domain names in a Chinese language environment,

Domain names consist of a string of characters and serve as addresses for identifying and locating websites on the internet. They play a crucial role in the online world, as they can replace website IP addresses, making it more convenient for users to access websites. Their fundamental functions include website identification, IP address mapping, website access points, branding, and email services.

In summary, the fundamental roles of domain names are IP redirection and traffic generation.

1\. IP Redirection:

Domain name redirection is a technique that redirects a domain to a different URL or webpage. This means that when a user enters or clicks on a domain, they are automatically directed to a predefined destination URL. It is commonly used for brand redirection, regional website redirection, and content updates.

IP redirection is highly important and is the core functionality of domain names. It provides websites with flexible management and the ability to direct traffic. For brands, IP redirection is beneficial in enhancing brand image, improving user experience, and maintaining search engine rankings.

2\. Traffic Generation:

The core idea of domain name traffic generation is to attract users through the domain name itself. A good domain name can instantly capture users' attention and pique their interest. A high-quality, unique, and attractive domain name can draw users' eyes by expressing the value and uniqueness it offers. Many well-known brands attract significant traffic through domain name searches, positioning, and marketing techniques. Some domain names with historical significance have become iconic in themselves. Therefore, domain name traffic generation is an essential tool in online business activities.

3\. Domain Names – "Virtual Real Estate" for Businesses:

The creation of domain names initially aimed to provide a more intuitive way for users to access websites, especially when they couldn't recall website IP addresses. With the rise of search engines and e-commerce, many businesses have transitioned from traditional web page shopping to mobile apps and WeChat mini-programs. In this context, one might wonder, is a domain name still important in the internet environment?

Companies like 360 invested ¥110 million to acquire 360.com, JD.com spent ¥30,000,000 to acquire jd.com, and Xiaomi's mi.com was valued at ¥22,430,000. These internet giants were willing to pay a high price for unique brand domain names. This is because, for businesses, domain names are their storefronts, the physical manifestation of their trademarks. In the 21st century, online businesses hold an increasingly important position. It can be said that domain names are the "virtual real estate" of businesses.

In the online world, domain names still play a crucial role:

1\. Brand Image Building:

A concise, easy-to-remember domain name that is highly relevant to the brand can help businesses establish their brand image and increase brand recognition. Sometimes, customers may even judge a website's credibility and professionalism based on the domain name.

2\. Direct Access:

Many websites have highly recognizable domain names, allowing users to directly enter the domain name to access the site without relying on search engines. This is particularly important for websites that have built a user base and gained recognition.

3\. Marketing:

Domain names can be used in marketing campaigns, such as featuring them in advertisements, flyers, or other promotional materials to attract the attention of the target audience and guide them to the website. Many major brands prominently display their domain names on various promotional materials.

4\. Geographical Targeting:

Domain names can also be used for geographical targeting, redirecting users to websites in specific languages based on their geographic location. This is especially important for websites targeting multiple regions or language groups.

Excellent, refined, and symbolically meaningful domain names have always been highly regarded, and their value continues to rise. While search capabilities for domain names may have slightly diminished in a Chinese language environment, it is undeniable that having a high-quality domain name still plays a significant role in reducing search costs for businesses.
